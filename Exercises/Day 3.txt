Create a document providing all steps for
publishing using self contained and dependent mode

1. Introduction
When publishing a .NET application, you have two primary deployment modes:

a)Framework-Dependent Deployment (FDD)
The application depends on the .NET runtime installed on the target machine.
The published package is smaller.
Requires the correct .NET runtime version to be installed on the host system.

b)Self-Contained Deployment (SCD)
The application includes the .NET runtime.
No need for .NET to be installed on the host system.
The published package is larger because it bundles the runtime.

2. Pre-requisites
.NET SDK installed on your machine (e.g., .NET 7.0 or 8.0)
Visual Studio or CLI
A .NET project ready to publish

3. Steps
3.1 Framework-Dependent Deployment
Open your project in Visual Studio.
Right-click the project in Solution Explorer → Publish.
Click Start → choose Folder (or any target).
Click Next → select Framework-Dependent.
Click Finish → then click Publish.
Your application is now published to the specified folder. It will require the .NET runtime installed on the target machine.

3.2 Self-Contained Deployment
Open your project in Visual Studio.
Right-click the project → Publish.
Click Start → choose Folder.
Click Next → select Self-Contained.
Choose Target Runtime depending on the OS:
win-x64 → Windows 64-bit
win-arm64 → Windows ARM
linux-x64 → Linux 64-bit
Click Finish → then click Publish.
Your application will now include the .NET runtime and can run on any machine without installing .NET.

4. Running the Published Application
Navigate to the published folder:
cd <publish-folder-path>
Run the application:
Windows:MyApp.exe
Linux/macOS:./MyApp
